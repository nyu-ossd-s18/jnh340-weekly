## Part 1 -- The cathedral vs. bazaar models of software development

In the Cathedral and the Bazaar, so and so outlines two different frameworks in which software can be developed. The cathedral model he presents is more conventional, and represents a closed process where a smaller, insular group of developers work in isolation to create some large potentially splendid project. The author originally held the conventional wisdom that more complex and intricate software projects could only be reliably developed in this cathedral-esque manner. Releases only happen after a long amount of heavily directed development has taken place, typically without the release of a beta.

The bazaar model, in contrast, corresponds to projects are open-sourced, where the code base is available to a large audience holding "many different agendas and approaches". With such a large and diverse set of eyes looking at and working on the code, bugs are found fast and development can take place at a rate much greater than projects that lack the same transparency, such as cathedrals.

I think that as a beginner, the idea of working in a cathedral environment sounds initially more appealing. I feel that, given my relatively limited knowledge, I would benefit greatly from the direction that inevitably comes from such a structured project. However, although it would be more uncomfortable from the outset, I'm sure that working in a bazaar environment would provide a more diverse set of voices upon which there are lessons to be drawn.
