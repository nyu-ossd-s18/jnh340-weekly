## What Does Open Source Mean To Me?

When I hear the term *Open Source* thrown around, a lot of abstract ideas come to mind. Words like collaboration, cooperation, and community. Until only a week ago when I started taking this course *Open Source* wasn't something I thought much about. I loosely understood some of the  general advantages that come from organizing a project in such a way, and knew of the classic amazing examples of open source done right like the Linux Kernel and Firefox. 

Some of the potential advantages are things that we have discussed already in class and that are mentioned in the assigned readings. By making a code base publicly available and allowing anyone to at least attempt to participate in its development, you can create amazing things with relatively low financial overhead. It also encourages users of the software to work with the source code and outsources testing and debugging to a free community of people who might be eager to get involved.

I'm not sure how legitimate of a concern this is, but I think there are some financial disadvantages that might emerge in a project that is open sourced. I remember a few years ago watching a documentary on 3D printing. One of the companies featured in the film was initially very committed to open sourcing their entire code base. This conviction seemed to be mainly about generating good PR for their company, and after some initial success the company  reneged on that promise. This may be a corner-case, but that whole scenario seemed really sketchy and kind of dishonest. I feel like if you start a project as open source, you should do all you can to maintain that standard. Those responsible for making these kinds of positions were in a tough place where they had to weigh their responsibility to do right by their company against their ideological convictions. I guess the disadvantage here (which is kind of unavoidable given the nature of open source) is that if you are committed to open source you are making a commitment to a movement larger than just the success of your own project. 

## Open Source Projects I Use

### Firefox

Firefox was the first non-standardly installed web browser that I used. Firefox is a free and open source web browser developed and maintained by Mozilla Foundation. I find it intersting and sort of inspirational as one of the first web browsers to challenge internet explorer for market share while also being an open source project. There are many alternate web browsers such as Safari and Google Chrome.

### MediaWiki

MediaWiki is a free open source software that is used in many wiki based sites. For example, Wikipedia and Wiktionary both run MediaWiki. This is a tool that many people have to thank for making acquisiton and maintenance of all kinds of information a more feasible task. Some alternate wiki softwares are *Tiki* and *DokuWiki*.
