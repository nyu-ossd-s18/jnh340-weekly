This week we were asked to edit a wikipedia article of our choosing as an introduction to contributing to openly sourced repositories of information.

As soon as you make a wikipedia account, you are prompted to begin your patronage by immediately editing an article. A series of click boxes indicate the links that will take you to a random article to start editing. I didn't have any strong feelings about a particular page I wanted to contribute to, so I allowed the site to provide a random article. I was first given a page on some UN resolution, but most of the suggested edits were related to citations/incorrect information. These seemed a little inaccessible to me, so I clicked a link that appeared to be given a new random article.

The next page was an article about a reservoir in Indonesia, and many of the issues associated with the page were copyedits that needed to be made. I spent some time revising the wording, grammar, and spelling of the first few paragraphs of the article. You can view the changes I made by clicking the following this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gajah_Mungkur_Dam&diff=prev&oldid=825742126).
