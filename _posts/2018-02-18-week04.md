This week we were asked to both begin tracking problems via the site CodeTriage and to start reporting and fixing bugs that were created on the class website.

## Course Website Debugging

I was a little late to the game in claiming bug fixes, so I am still waiting to have a bug assigned for me to handle. I expressed by desire to claim a few issues.

1) A typo in a link to a [resource] (https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/63). I also reported this issue.

2) Information is missing regarding tutoring in the class resources section of the site. [Link to issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/45).

3) An improperly labelled link that also links to the wrong portion of a page. [Link to issue](https://github.com/joannakl/cs480_s18/issues/23)
