## Open Data Week (Rescheduled Events)

I did not attend any new open data week events this week.

## New Contributions

I have not made any new contributions this week. I know, I know, things are gonna be busy getting all of those done.

## Project Progress

We are all continuing to make progress on our respective components of the progress. One hiccup I encountered is that there doesn't seem to be a streamlined way of accessing file contents for files that are not in focus in the editor. The extension will only be able to refactor css files that are in context in the editor.

Another slight issue is that it I've had some trouble getting libraries to parse css files and generate a document object representing the CSS rules to work within the brackets environment. I plan to look at other projects that have incorporated third-party libraries and see how they integrate them, and mimic their methods.
